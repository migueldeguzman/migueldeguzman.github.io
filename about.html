	<p class="aboutstyle">
		I worked as a public accountant for 10 years in the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea and Dubai, UAE of which gives me a deeper edge in analyzing use cases of different technologies that is available today in the market. As a self-taught coder, I have drawn inspiration on my past successes on other fields of expertise like internal audit, business development, marketing, warehouse management, speaking spanish, flying drones. I love to travel and experience different cultures all over the world. My philosophical view in life is stoicism and practices meditation daily. I dedicate my life now in building projects that promote improvements to businesses and the environment.
