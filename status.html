	<h1>I'm an Effective Altruist</h1>
	<p class="aboutstyle">
	 <br>
	For too long we've been relying on low resolution ideologies to guide our limited understanding of the world. <br>
	My stand for the future of humanity is that we must do what we can to discern the truth and build a more sustainable global economy. <br>
	The current system is clearly unsustainable, as evinced by compelling evidence all around us. <br>
	Our reliance on antiquated ideologies is holding us back from making the necessary changes. <br>
	We need to wake up and act now, or else the future will be worse for everyone. <br>
	As stewards of this magnificent world, it's our responsibility to make sure that the future is better for all. <br>
	Let's do what we can to make that happen.<br><br><br>
